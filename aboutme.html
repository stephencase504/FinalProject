<h3>I was born in Visalia, CA and raised in Tulare, CA.
<br><br>I also have autism spectrum disorder which in a nutshell means that<br>my brain processes things and thinks divergently than most people would.<br><br>
I however have over the years used my autism to my advantage<br>to get me ahead of my life. And I have had a lot of highs and lows<br>but have grown stronger over the years.<br><br>
People have often called me the following:<br><br>A punctual individual<br><br>A good team player<br><br>A great communicator<br><br>A positive-minded person<h3>

    <h3>March 25th, 1996</h3>
    <p>Born in Visalia, California<br>and raised in Tulare, California</p>
  </div>
  <h5>I was born in Visalia, California and grew up<br>in Tulare, California while being on the autism spectrum.<br><br>
While everyone in my hometown often worked everyday monotonously,<br>I would often look at logos, magazine covers,<br>billboards, and packaging labels everywhere I went<br>as I would always notice if designs or trends changed.<br><br>
I guess you could say that was<br>where my journey as a graphic designer began.</h5>
  <div class="event">
    <h3>August 2011</h3>
    <p>Started attending Mission Oak High School<br>in Tulare, California</p>
  </div>
  <h5>I was a very studious student growing up as<br>I would often get good grades, but I also had a<br>difficult time making and keeping friends due to my autism.<br><br>

However, when I got to Mission Oak High School, I was accepted<br>with open arms and opportunities started opening up for me.<br><br>

I helped redesign the varsity football helmets, made posters<br>for numerous sporting events, and even gave good<br>ideas for ASB to promote school spirit.</h5>
  <div class="event">
    <h3>June 2015</h3>
    <p>Graduated from Mission Oak High School<br>as a co-valedictorian with high honors</p>
  </div>
  <h5>I graduated Mission Oak in 2015 as a co-valedictorian<br>and was even named most spirited for my graduating class.<br><br>

I had high honors in all subjects. High school was like a home away<br>from home as it allowed me to blossom and be free as an autistic individual<br>and I consider high school to be the best years of my life.</h5>
  <div class="event">
    <h3>August 2015</h3>
    <p>Started attending the College of the Sequoias<br>in Visalia, California</p>
  </div>
  <h5>I started COS in 2015 and realized right away that college was not<br>like high school as everyone was less sociable and more career focused.<br><br>

I had enrolled as a part-time student as I did not want<br>to stress myself out too much and wanted to go slow and steady.<br><br>

In 2019 however, I was getting burned out and I decided<br>to take a break for a year to get my mind cleared up<br>and had planned to return in the Fall of 2020 to finish my degree...<br><br>

...And then the COVID-19 Pandemic came.<br><br>

During the pandemic, I was stuck at home<br>wondering if there was even a future for me.<br>
I honestly was at the lowest point in my life.<br><br>

But then in 2022, society was finally allowed to do normal activities<br>and I decided to finish what I started at COS and complete my degree.<br><br>This time as a full-time student.<br><br>
</h5>
  <div class="event">
    <h3>April 2024</h3>
    <p>Started Graphic Design/Marketing internship<br>with the Visalia Rawhide Baseball Club</p>
  </div>
  <h5>In my final year at COS, I managed to secure an internship<br>with the Visalia Rawhide Baseball Club to be their<br>Graphic Design and Marketing intern through the COS Work Experience Program.<br><br>
  I have a deep love for baseball and graphic design<br>and I have had such a blast being able<br>to be part of something bigger than myself.</h5>
  <div class="event">
    <h3>May 2024</h3>
    <p>Graduated College of the Sequoias with<br>Associate of Science in Graphic Design</p>
  </div>
  <h5>
I graduated with an Associate of Science in Graphic Design<br>and also earned my Skill Certificates in Multimedia Design and Photoshop.<br><br>
I feel so blessed to be able to come this far and cannot wait<br>to see where my career as a designer takes me!</h5>
